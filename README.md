## Abstract

The **SMETA Axiom** is a structural and axiomatic framework proposed to organize
the fundamental components involved in the emergence, persistence,
interaction, and dissolution of existence.

SMETA is not a reductionist physical theory and does not replace existing
scientific laws. Instead, it functions as an **organizational axiom** that
indexes and connects independently formulated operational bases describing
existence across physical, dynamical, and regulatory dimensions.

The acronym **SMETA** denotes five operational components:

- **S — Space:** the domain in which configurations and relations are defined  
- **M — Mass:** localized density or occupancy representing embodied existence  
- **E — Energy:** intrinsic state or interaction functional governing transitions  
- **T — Time:** emergent ordering parameter arising from process evolution  
- **A — Atman:** intrinsic regulatory or ordering principle, defined operationally  

The SMETA Axiom provides a unified conceptual scaffold without introducing
additional ontological assumptions beyond those explicitly defined in its
constituent bases.

## Axiomatic Statement

> **SMETA Axiom:**  
> Any existent system may be operationally described through the coupled
> interaction of Space, Mass, Energy, and Time, regulated by an intrinsic
> ordering principle (Atman), such that emergence, interaction, persistence,
> and dissolution arise as bounded, process-driven phenomena.

Atman is treated **operationally**, not metaphysically, and represents an
internal regulator that biases admissible state transitions without violating
physical laws.

## Constituent Bases

The SMETA framework links the following independently formulated bases:

### Base–I: Δ–Process Model  
A minimal process-based model describing cyclic emergence and dissolution
from an undifferentiated state using discrete Δ-steps.

### Base–II: Freedom–Unity Principle  
A single-source functional framework in which attraction and repulsion arise
as complementary expressions of an intrinsic potential, governing cohesion
and dispersion without invoking dual forces.

### Base–III: Rajatsubhra Infinity Series (R-Series)  
A pulse-driven bounded activation model representing existence as a regulated
oscillatory state between manifestation and dissolution.

### Base–IV: RSFD (R-Series Field Dynamics)  
A field-theoretic extension describing distributed interactions, induced
forces, emergent phase-time, and particle-level dynamics derived from the
Freedom–Unity functional.

Each base is mathematically and operationally self-contained and may be used
independently. The SMETA Axiom serves as their structural unifier.

## Scope and Intent

- SMETA does **not** claim empirical finality  
- It is compatible with classical, quantum, and emergent systems  
- It does not replace physics, biology, or neuroscience  
- It provides a **framework for integration**, not substitution  

The model is intentionally discipline-agnostic and may be explored in
physics, complex systems, consciousness studies, biological organization,
and integrative health sciences.

## Status

- Conceptual framework: **Frozen**

- Illustrative models and simulations: **In progress**
- Peer review and dissemination: **Planned**
